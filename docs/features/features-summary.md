# Multi-Source Stock Data Aggregation — Features Summary

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-28  
**Document Type**: Executive Summary  
**Classification**: Product Management Record

---

## 1. Feature Overview

### Problem Statement

The current MCP server implementation is tightly coupled to Yahoo Finance as a single data source. While Yahoo Finance provides comprehensive data, users need:

- **Diverse news coverage** from multiple financial sources
- **Data reliability** through automatic fallback when sources are unavailable
- **Source preferences** configured per data type (prices, fundamentals, options, etc.)
- **Deduplication** to eliminate duplicate news stories across providers
- **Flexible architecture** to easily add new data providers in the future

### Vision

Transform the Yahoo Finance MCP Server into a flexible, multi-source stock information aggregation platform with intelligent routing, automatic failover, and duplicate news filtering—all while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

### Feature Goals

1. **Complete MCP Tool Coverage**: Implement all 10 required MCP tools, including the missing `get_market_news`
2. **Provider Abstraction**: Enable pluggable architecture to support multiple data sources
3. **Intelligent Routing**: Route requests to configured providers per data type with automatic failover
4. **Resilient Failover**: Gracefully handle provider failures using circuit breaker pattern and health monitoring
5. **Duplicate Filtering**: Automatically detect and merge duplicate news stories across sources
6. **Configuration-Driven**: Support externalized configuration without code changes

## 3. Phase 1: Foundation & Parity

**Completion Date**: February 27, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED (A+ Rating)  
**Approval**: GitHub Copilot (Product Manager)

### Key Deliverables

- ✅ **Feature Parity Achieved** — Implemented missing `get_market_news` tool; all 10 required MCP tools now operational
- ✅ **IStockDataProvider Interface** — Created pluggable provider abstraction using strategy pattern for easy provider integration
- ✅ **YahooFinanceProvider Adapter** — Wrapped existing Yahoo Finance client with input validation and health checks
- ✅ **JSON Configuration System** — External configuration file support with environment variable expansion, schema validation, and sensible defaults
- ✅ **StockDataProviderRouter** — Request routing component for intelligent provider selection (prepared for Phase 2 enhancements)
- ✅ **HTTP Security Hardening** — Enforced TLS 1.2/1.3, 30-second timeout, 10MB response buffer limits, and secrets redaction in error messages
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Coverage** — 86 unit tests + 31 MCP server tests + 30 integration tests; 117/117 unit/MCP tests passing (100%)

### Architecture Changes

From single-source coupling:
```
MCP Server → YahooFinanceClient → Yahoo Finance API
```

To provider-abstracted multi-source capable:
```
MCP Server → StockDataProviderRouter → IStockDataProvider → Data Source
```

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Maintained** — All existing functionality preserved; no breaking API changes; replacement-compatible with previous version.

## 4. Phase 2: Multi-Source Failover

**Completion Date**: February 27, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Test Results**: 141/141 tests passing (100%)

### Key Deliverables

- ✅ **Circuit Breaker Pattern** — Three-state implementation (Closed → Open → Half-Open) prevents cascading failures; configurable failure thresholds; per-provider state management
- ✅ **Failover Chain Implementation** — Automatic failover through configurable provider chains (primary → fallback 1 → fallback 2); health-aware routing skips unhealthy providers; aggregated error reporting
- ✅ **Provider Health Monitoring** — Real-time health tracking with rolling 5-minute metrics window; consecutive failure detection; error rate calculation; average response time tracking; automatic recovery on success
- ✅ **Intelligent Error Classification** — Structured error categorization (network errors, timeouts, rate limits, authentication, service errors) with detailed aggregation
- ✅ **Structured Logging & Telemetry** — Comprehensive logging at each failover step; provider selection decisions documented; performance metrics tracked
- ✅ **Non-Functional Requirements Met** — Failover completes in < 5 seconds (NFR-2); circuit breaker overhead < 1ms; health check interval configurable (default 60s)

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "yahoo_finance",
      "type": "YahooFinanceProvider",
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "backup_provider",
      "type": "BackupProvider",
      "priority": 2
    }
  ],
  "routing": {
    "dataTypeRouting": {
      "StockInfo": {
        "primaryProviderId": "yahoo_finance",
        "fallbackProviderIds": ["backup_provider"],
        "timeoutSeconds": 30
      }
    }
  },
  "circuitBreaker": {
    "enabled": true,
    "failureThreshold": 3,
    "halfOpenAfterSeconds": 60
  }
}
```

### Failover Behavior

When a provider fails, the system automatically:

1. Records the failure for health monitoring
2. Attempts next configured fallback provider
3. Skips providers with open circuit breakers
4. Returns first successful result or aggregated errors if all fail
5. Logs all transitions and error details for visibility

## 5. Phase 3: News Deduplication

**Status**: 🔄 PLANNED (Foundation Ready)  
**Approval**: Authorized pending Phase 3 kickoff

### Planned Deliverables

- **Similarity Detection Algorithm** — Identify duplicate news stories across multiple sources based on title, summary, and content similarity
- **Configurable Thresholds** — Adjustable similarity threshold (default 85%) for duplication matching
- **Merged News Results** — Consolidate duplicates with attribution to all sources that published the story
- **Source Attribution** — Preserve earliest publication time; credit all source coverage in merged result
- **Enable/Disable Toggles** — Configuration-driven feature enablement without code changes
- **Performance Target** — < 500ms deduplication overhead on news aggregation

### Configuration Preparation

```json
{
  "newsDeduplication": {
    "enabled": true,
    "similarityThreshold": 0.85,
    "timestampWindowHours": 24,
    "compareContent": true
  }
}
```

## 6. Architecture

### High-Level Design

**Key Components**:

- **IStockDataProvider** — Abstraction defining provider contract (10 methods for all MCP tools)
- **StockDataProviderRouter** — Central request router with failover, circuit breaking, and health awareness
- **CircuitBreaker** — Three-state pattern preventing cascading failures
- **ProviderHealthMonitor** — Real-time health tracking with rolling metrics
- **Configuration System** — JSON-based externalized configuration with validation

### For Detailed Design Documentation
